# Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space
Kaggle competition "using satellite data to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest"

## Project details
The goal of the project is the classify different images of the amazon in different category such as "cloudy", "habitation", "roads". Every image can combine different categories. The model tested for this competition are CNNs such as VGG, ResNet, Inception of DenseNet. The library used is keras with Tensorflow backend. Code is mine but some part are freely inspired from discussion of the Kaggle competition forum.

## Getting started
All models can be lauched from the notebook. Data can be fine on the Kaggle competition page, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/overview)
